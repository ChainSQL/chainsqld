## Overview

Basing on the ripple's source code, we added chainsql's own database related modules. The DB operating log will be stored in the chainsql chain, then you can acquire the visual data in traditional DB.

# Details of ChainSQL

By setting the sync_tables, sync_db and auto_sync, you can restore the real DB tables you wanted from block chain. You can set the DB type arbitrarily, includeing mysql, sqlite, oracle and so on.

We defined three new transaction types for the DB operation, named sqlStatement, tableListSet and sqlTransaction. sqlStatement is used to insert, update or delete records, tableListSet is used to create a table and other operations to the table-self, sqlTransaction is used to operator a set of DB sql clause in one blockchain's transaction.

You can operate the DB or send DB operations to the block chain by the following four ways.

1. RPC API , supplied by the RPC modules.
2. Web sockets API, developed using javascript and java. Refer to [API in javascript](http://www.chainsql.net/api_javascript.html) and [API in java](http://www.chainsql.net/api_java.html) .
3. Commandline, access to the node directly.
4. By kingshrad, using db's primitive sql clause. Refer to[Access by sql](http://www.chainsql.net/api_mysql.html).

The table module send data request to other nodes and sort the tx datas from other nodes, then give the right transaction data to the  sql module. This module also seeks every ledger in local block chain to get the compatible table data to send back to the required nodes.

The sql module analysis transaction data to get the real sql, then operate the DB ussing these real sql sentences.

Further more, storage modules make you check the DB before sending tx data to the block chain, this makes it possible that we can operate DB timely.
