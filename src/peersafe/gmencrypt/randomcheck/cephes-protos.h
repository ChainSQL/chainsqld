Purpose:    
Provide NIST Statistical Test Suite (those tests that can be used 
with short bit streams) as library through the API creation.

Warnings:
- Porting issues.
- In order to create the library the inner original code has been modified in
  some cases.
- Tested over openSUSE 10.2 x86 32 bits.
