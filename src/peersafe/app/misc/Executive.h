	/**
	* @brief Message-call/contract-creation executor; useful for executing transactions.
	*
	* Two ways of using this class - either as a transaction executive or a CALL/CREATE executive.
	*
	* In the first use, after construction, begin with initialize(), then execute() and end with finalize(). Call go()
	* after execute() only if it returns false.
	*
	* In the second use, after construction, begin with call() or create() and end with
	* accrueSubState(). Call go() after call()/create() only if it returns false.
	*
	* Example:
	* @code
	* Executive e(state, blockchain, 0);
	* e.initialize(transaction);
	* if (!e.execute())
	*    e.go();
	* e.finalize();
	* @endcode
